## This is my github page

### What have I been up to?

I've been writing a lot of smaller projects and not commiting them.
This is due to many factors, but I'll strive to do a bit more in the future.

### I did just make this page so I guess we're getting somewhere. . . 

Here are a few little projects I've played with over time:

* [Twitter API Example - Python / Tweepy](https://github.com/jdflick/twitterTweepyTest)
* [Doc Files to Excel - Python / Docx](https://github.com/jdflick/convertDocTablesToExcel)
* [Convert Cells to Values - Excel Macro](https://github.com/jdflick/excelValueCleanse)

### There's more stuff in my [Github](https://github.com/jdflick), little snippets and resources and a few Linux toys
Hop in if you'd like.
